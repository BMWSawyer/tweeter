# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone application.

It has provided the opportunity to fork and clone an existing respository and then then build upon it to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.


## Final Product

These are three screenshots of the single-page web application in use. The first is the user registration page, the second is the URLs list page, and the third is the individual URL/URL edit page.
